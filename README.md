cs429 - Really Cool Game
========================

Project Description
-------------------
Our project was to create an action RPG video game. The goal of the game is to explore the world searching for objects, fighting various enemies during the process. Once all of the objects are collected, a final boss will appear, which must be defeated to complete the game. We pulled a lot of inspiration for the game from some of the original Legend of Zelda and Super Mario video games.

The game was created using Python 2.7.6 and the Pygame library. This allowed us to make the game cross-platform; however, our target platform was Debian GNU/Linux. Our main goal behind this project was to learn the basics of developing a game since the university does not offer a course dedicated to this topic.
