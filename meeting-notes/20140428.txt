Refactorings:
Andrew moved save functionality out of GameScreen and into more appropriate locations.

Bugs:
Spacing of bullets is based on position
Add tests for saving and loading, and saving when switching tiles
Add more tests for everything, including weird cases like being bounced between enemies.
Add a mock version of the random function. Possibly pass in a function as a parameter.
Try to add lettuce tests to the coverage tool.
Add more lettuce tests.
Consider creating script to run lettuce, unittests, and coverage tool all at once.
